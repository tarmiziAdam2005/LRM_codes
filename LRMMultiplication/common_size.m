% usage:  [errorcode] = common_size (x_1, ...)
%
% Determine if all input arguments are either scalar or of common
% size.  In this case, errorcode is zero, and y_i is a matrix of the
% common size with all entries equal to x_i if this is a scalar or
% x_i otherwise.
%
% If the inputs cannot be brought to a common size, errorcode is 1, and
% y_i is x_i.
%
% For example,
%
%   [errorcode] = common_size ([1 2; 3 4], 5)
%
% returns errorcode = 0, a = [1 2, 3 4], b = [5 5; 5 5].
%
% This is useful for implementing functions where arguments can either
% be scalars or of common size.
